            <div class="faq-question scroll-p" onclick="toggleAnswer('faq1')"> What is cancer risk prediction?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq1"> - Cancer risk prediction involves using data and models to estimate an individual's likelihood of developing cancer. This can be based on various factors like genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures.

            </div>
    
            <div class="faq-question scroll-p" onclick="toggleAnswer('faq2')">How does lifestyle affect cancer risk?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq2">- Lifestyle factors such as smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, and physical activity significantly influence cancer risk. For instance, smoking increases the risk of lung and other cancers, while a healthy diet and regular exercise can reduce cancer risk.
            </div>

            <div class="faq-question scroll-p" onclick="toggleAnswer('faq3')">Can cancer risk prediction prevent cancer?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq3"> - While it can't prevent cancer outright, accurate risk prediction helps in early detection and adopting healthier lifestyles, which can significantly lower the risk of developing cancer.

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq4"> - Genetic testing can be crucial for certain cancers, especially if there's a family history of cancer, as it helps identify inherited cancer risks.
            </div>

            <div class="faq-question scroll-p" onclick="toggleAnswer('faq5')">  How accurate are cancer risk prediction models?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq5">- The accuracy varies based on the model and the specific type of cancer. Advances in AI and machine learning have improved the accuracy significantly in recent years.
